# Research Summary: Module 4 Vision-Language-Action Implementation

## Decision: VLA Curriculum Structure
**Rationale**: Creating a logical hierarchy that progresses from basic VLA concepts to full pipeline integration, ensuring students build knowledge systematically.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Topical organization (all voice topics together, all vision topics together)
- Progressive learning structure from fundamentals to advanced concepts (selected)
- Reverse approach starting with full pipeline

**Findings**:
- Progressive structure best supports educational goals
- Students need foundational VLA knowledge before advanced integration
- Clear progression from individual components to system integration provides comprehensive coverage

## Decision: Chapter Topic Distribution
**Rationale**: Distributing 5 main topics across 5 chapters to ensure appropriate depth and breadth of coverage.
**Alternatives considered**:
- 3 broad chapters covering multiple topics each
- 5 detailed chapters with focused topics (selected)
- 4 balanced chapters

**Findings**:
- 5 chapters provide optimal balance of depth and coverage
- Allows sufficient detail for complex topics like LLM planning and vision manipulation
- Maintains manageable chapter length for students

## Decision: Docusaurus Integration Pattern
**Rationale**: Establishing consistent integration approach within Part V of the book.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Flat structure with all VLA content at same level
- Hierarchical structure by technology (voice vs vision vs action)
- Hierarchical structure by concept (selected)

**Findings**:
- Concept-based hierarchy supports learning progression
- Clear separation between individual components and integration
- Maintains consistency with other modules in the book

## Decision: LLM Tool Focus
**Rationale**: Determining appropriate focus on different LLM technologies within VLA content.
**Alternatives considered**:
- OpenAI-focused approach
- Multi-platform approach covering various LLMs
- Framework-focused approach (selected)

**Findings**:
- Framework-focused approach provides comprehensive understanding
- Students need to understand general principles rather than specific implementations
- Balance ensures no gaps in VLA knowledge

## Decision: Full Pipeline Integration Point
**Rationale**: Determining optimal point to introduce complete VLA pipeline integration.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Early introduction in first chapter
- Mid-module integration after individual components
- Advanced topic at the end (selected)

**Findings**:
- End placement allows students to understand individual components first
- Students can apply all previous concepts to full integration
- Natural progression from components to complete systems
