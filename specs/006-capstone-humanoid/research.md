# Research Summary: Capstone Autonomous Humanoid Implementation

## Decision: Capstone Curriculum Structure
**Rationale**: Creating a logical hierarchy that progresses from overview to final project, ensuring students build integration knowledge systematically.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Topical organization (all architecture topics together, all integration topics together)
- Progressive learning structure from overview to final project (selected)
- Reverse approach starting with final project

**Findings**:
- Progressive structure best supports educational goals
- Students need foundational capstone knowledge before detailed integration
- Clear progression from overview to implementation provides comprehensive coverage

## Decision: Chapter Topic Distribution
**Rationale**: Distributing 6 main topics across 5 chapters to ensure appropriate depth and breadth of coverage.
**Alternatives considered**:
- 3 broad chapters covering multiple topics each
- 5 detailed chapters with focused topics (selected)
- 4 balanced chapters

**Findings**:
- 5 chapters provide optimal balance of depth and coverage
- Allows sufficient detail for complex integration topics
- Maintains manageable chapter length for students

## Decision: Docusaurus Integration Pattern
**Rationale**: Establishing consistent integration approach within Part VI of the book.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Flat structure with all capstone content at same level
- Hierarchical structure by technology (ROS 2 vs Gazebo vs Isaac vs VLA)
- Hierarchical structure by concept (selected)

**Findings**:
- Concept-based hierarchy supports learning progression
- Clear separation between architecture and implementation
- Maintains consistency with other modules in the book

## Decision: Integration Focus
**Rationale**: Determining appropriate focus on different integration aspects within the capstone content.
**Alternatives considered**:
- ROS 2-focused integration
- Multi-module integration approach
- System-focused approach (selected)

**Findings**:
- System-focused approach provides comprehensive understanding
- Students need to understand integration of all previous modules
- Balance ensures no gaps in capstone knowledge

## Decision: Final Project Integration Point
**Rationale**: Determining optimal point to introduce complete capstone project implementation.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Early introduction in first chapter
- Mid-module integration after architecture
- Advanced topic at the end (selected)

**Findings**:
- End placement allows students to understand architecture first
- Students can apply all previous concepts to final project
- Natural progression from components to complete system implementation
