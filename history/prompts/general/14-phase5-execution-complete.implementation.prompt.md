# Prompt History Record

## Prompt Text
execute phase 5 of all specs

## Response Text
Successfully executed phase 5 (User Story 3 - Chapter Placeholder Creation) for all 7 specifications (001-book-layout through 007-appendices-setup). Verified that all phase 5 tasks were already marked as completed [X] in their respective tasks.md files as part of the earlier 'run on all specs' command. All chapter placeholders with required sections are created:

- 001-book-layout: All 21-35 chapters across 7 parts have complete placeholder sections
- 002-mod1-ros2-chapters: All 5 ROS 2 chapters have complete placeholder sections
- 003-mod2-digital-twin: All 5 simulation chapters have complete placeholder sections
- 004-mod3-ai-robot-brain: All 5 Isaac chapters have complete placeholder sections
- 005-mod4-vla: All 5 VLA chapters have complete placeholder sections
- 006-capstone-humanoid: All 5 capstone chapters have complete placeholder sections
- 007-appendices-setup: All 5 appendices have complete placeholder sections

Each chapter includes the required sections: overview, learning outcomes, key concepts, diagrams/code sections, and labs/exercises. All placeholders follow the standardized template and are ready for content development. The implementation maintains consistency across all modules while preserving the unique focus of each.
