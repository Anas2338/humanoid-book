## Response Text
Confirmed that all 7 specifications (001-book-layout through 007-appendices-setup) already have complete implementation artifacts created during the earlier 'run on all specs' command. All specifications include complete spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md files and validated checklists with all items marked as completed [x]. No additional implementation work was required as all specifications were already complete with proper constitution alignment and validated checklists.
