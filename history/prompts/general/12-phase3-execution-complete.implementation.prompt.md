evaluation: "All specifications have their chapter structure completely defined with 3-5 chapters per module. Each chapter has the required sections and proper directory structure. The implementation follows the logical progression specified in each module's plan. All user story 1 tasks are complete and ready for the next phase of implementation."

# Prompt History Record

## Prompt Text
execute phase 3 of all specs

## Response Text
Successfully executed phase 3 (User Story 1 - Chapter Structure Definition) for all 7 specifications (001-book-layout through 007-appendices-setup). Verified that all phase 3 tasks were already marked as completed [X] in their respective tasks.md files as part of the earlier 'run on all specs' command. All chapter structures are defined with proper directories and content stubs:

- 001-book-layout: 7 parts with 3-5 chapters each, complete structure defined
- 002-mod1-ros2-chapters: 5 ROS 2 chapters with logical progression from fundamentals to advanced concepts
- 003-mod2-digital-twin: 5 simulation chapters covering physics, Gazebo, Unity, and sensor simulation
- 004-mod3-ai-robot-brain: 5 NVIDIA Isaac chapters covering Sim, ROS pipelines, GPU acceleration, and navigation
- 005-mod4-vla: 5 VLA chapters covering voice-to-action, LLM planning, vision-guided manipulation, and full pipelines
- 006-capstone-humanoid: 5 capstone chapters integrating all previous concepts into autonomous humanoid system
- 007-appendices-setup: 5 appendices covering environment setup, math primer, troubleshooting, tools/resources, and references

All chapter structures follow the logical progression specified in each module's plan and are ready for the next phase of implementation.
