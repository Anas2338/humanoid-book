# Prompt History Record

## Prompt Text
create plan for all specs

## Response Text
Confirmed that all specifications already had plan.md files created during the earlier "run on all specs" command. Verified that 6 out of 7 specifications already had complete planning artifacts (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md). Identified that 002-mod1-ros2-chapters was missing the research.md, data-model.md, and quickstart.md files and created these missing files to complete the planning suite. All specifications now have complete planning artifacts with technical context, constitution checks, research findings, data models, and quickstart guides properly structured and aligned with the project constitution.
