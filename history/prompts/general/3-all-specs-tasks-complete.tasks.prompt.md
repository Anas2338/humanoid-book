Confirmed that all 7 specifications (001-book-layout through 007-appendices-setup) already have comprehensive tasks.md files created during the earlier "run on all specs" command. All tasks are organized by user story with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. No additional task creation was required as all specifications were already complete with proper structure and user story organization.
