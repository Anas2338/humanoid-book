outcome: "Verified that all 7 specifications (001-book-layout through 007-appendices-setup) already comply with the project constitution. All specifications include proper technical accuracy sections, user-centric exposition, spec-driven structure, safety-aligned content, source quality validation, and Docusaurus standards as required by the constitution."
evaluation: "All specifications were created during the earlier 'run on all specs' command with proper constitution alignment. Each specification includes required sections like user stories, functional requirements, success criteria, and proper technical context. No modifications were needed as all specifications already meet constitution requirements."
