# Prompt History Record

## Prompt Text
execute phase 2 of all specs

## Response Text
Successfully executed phase 2 (Foundational Blocking Prerequisites) for all 7 specifications (001-book-layout through 007-appendices-setup). Verified that all foundational tasks were already marked as completed [X] in their respective tasks.md files. Created the complete Docusaurus project structure including:

- Directory structure for all 7 book parts (docs/part-i-introduction-foundations/ through docs/part-vii-appendices/)
- Docusaurus configuration files (docusaurus.config.js, sidebars.js)
- Package manifest (package.json) with Docusaurus dependencies
- Custom CSS styling (src/css/custom.css)
- README.md with project overview
- Initial chapter stubs for Part I and Part II

The foundational setup includes proper navigation framework, chapter templates, and content structure that follows the project constitution requirements. All specifications now have their core infrastructure complete and are ready for user story implementation phases (Phase 3 and beyond). The Docusaurus site is properly configured for GitHub Pages deployment with proper integration of all 7 book parts.
