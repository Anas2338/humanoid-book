# Prompt History Record

## Prompt Text
write detail specification of 002-mod1-ros2-chapters according to existing project layout

## Response Text
Confirmed that the 002-mod1-ros2-chapters specification was previously updated with detailed module architecture, including comprehensive chapter structure with detailed topic distribution for all 5 chapters (ROS 2 Fundamentals, Communication Patterns, Python Integration, Robot Description, and Workspace Structure). The specification already contained complete Docusaurus folder structure with proper file naming conventions, detailed naming conventions for files, IDs, and section headers, a standard chapter template structure with required sections, and technical infrastructure requirements. All original user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria were preserved from the earlier 'run on all specs' command.
