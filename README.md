# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

This repository contains the source code for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book, built with Docusaurus and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## About

This book provides a comprehensive guide to building humanoid robots that bridge the gap between digital AI and physical systems. It covers robotics fundamentals, ROS 2, digital twins, AI integration, vision-language-action systems, and culminates in a capstone autonomous humanoid project.

## Structure

The book is organized into 7 parts:

1. **Introduction & Foundations** - Core concepts and theoretical background
2. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - ROS 2 fundamentals and communication patterns
3. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Physics simulation and environment modeling
4. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - AI integration and cognitive systems
5. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Multimodal perception and interaction
6. **Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid** - Complete system integration
7. **Appendices** - Tools, setup, troubleshooting, and references

## Development
